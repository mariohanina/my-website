## Art Gallery

This section showcases my artwork. I regularly update it with new pieces. Feel free to browse through my creations and enjoy the visual experience.

## Photo Gallery

As I travel, I capture moments and scenes from various places. This gallery is a collection of photos from my journeys. Each photo tells a story and reflects my experiences. The location where each photo was taken is provided underneath it, in case you want to visit that place.

## Image Viewer

The Image Viewer enhances both the Art Gallery and the Photo Gallery by allowing you to view images in full resolution. Simply click or tap on any thumbnail in either gallery to open the image in the Image Viewer.

### Features:

- **Zoom**: If you are using a mouse with a scroll wheel, hold the shift key and use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Panning**: Click and drag to move around the image while zoomed in.
- **Reset Zoom**: Double-click on the image to restore it to its default zoom level.

This interactive viewer ensures you can appreciate the details of each piece of art and photograph to their fullest extent.

## Spanish Flashcards App

This app quizzes users on their Spanish vocabulary by showing a word in Spanish and prompting them to enter the English meaning. The app includes several word categories to choose from. Users can track their progress by the increasing score for each correct answer.

## Stocks App

This app allows users to search for a company and view its stock prices over time. The stock prices are displayed in a line graph, providing a visual representation of the trends. Users can choose any time range for the data being displayed, allowing for flexible and detailed analysis of stock performance.
